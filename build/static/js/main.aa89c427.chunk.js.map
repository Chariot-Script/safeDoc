Consultative Service\n            </h3>\n            The purpose of the service provided through the Site is to give patients and their\n            physicians access to additional information which they may or may not choose to\n            utilize in planning medical care. It is not a substitute for primary care. The\n            service provided through the Site varies by condition and by state of residence\n            of the patient with special emphasis on providing a medical opinion (which is NOT\n            a medical diagnosis and cannot substitute the advice of a licensed medical doctor\n            in your jurisdiction). In some cases the online nature of the service will make it\n            diﬃcult to verify a medical opinion (particularly with conditions that rely heavily\n            on direct physician-patient interaction for accurate opinion). In those cases,\n            the service provided through the Site will focus on the assessment or recommendation\n            of treatment options.\n            <br />\n                <br />\n            The service provided through this Site differs from the diagnostic services typically\n            provided by a physician. safeDoc will not have the benefit of information that would\n            be obtained by examining you in person and observing your physical condition. Therefore,\n            safeDoc may not be aware of facts or information that would affect the medical opinion\n            issued. To reduce the risk to you of this limitation, the Company strongly encourages\n            you to discuss the medical opinion with your physician. By deciding to engage the\n            services of this Site, you acknowledge and agree that you are aware of this limitation\n            and agree to assume the risk of this limitation. Furthermore, you agree and accept that:\n            <br />\n            (i) the diagnosis you will receive is limited and provisional;\n            <br />\n            (ii) the medical opinion is not intended to replace a full medical evaluation or an i\n            n-person visit with a physician;\n            <br />\n            (iii) the medical professionals providing services through this Site do not have\n            important information that is usually obtained through a physical examination; and\n            <br />\n            (iv) the absence of a physical examination may affect the medical professional’s\n            ability to diagnose your condition, disease or injury. You also agree that the second\n            opinion will not be used in any legal dispute including but not limited to litigation,\n            arbitration, claim for disability benefits, claim for worker’s compensation and/or\n            malpractice claims without the prior written consent of the Company.\n            <br />\n                <br />\n                <h3 className=\"services__title\">\n                    5.
